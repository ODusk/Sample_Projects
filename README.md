# Studies Transcripts & Sample Projects(Jupyter Notebooks format)
Here you can browse some samples code of my work and education in the field of machine learning (ML) and data science (DS). Due to the sensitivity of the data I used during some projects and other cooperation mediums (i.e. other than github), I am unable to share the code/data of these projects. Pseudo-anonymous papers (e.g. project Audax) are provided in the 'Papers' directory if appropriate. 

On this page you may also view my transcripts.
